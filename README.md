# UnixUtilities
Contains simple utilities to be used in a command line such as wcat, wgrep, wunzip, and wzip.

Created as a project for Operating Systems class I was taking.

wcat - reads a file and prints its contents.

wgrep - looks through a file and prints out any line that contains the given search term.

wzip and wunzip - compresses and decompresses files using RLE(run-length encoding).
